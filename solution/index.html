  <p>In my native tongue Ewe /Ɛʋɛ/, a language spoken in parts of Ghana, Togo, and Benin, we have a proverb that says, “Atadi lɛ vɛvɛm, gakɛ ŋɔ lɛ ɛmɛ tsi agbɛ”. To wit “Within the pepper, it’s scorching, yet the worm thrives in it”.</p>

  <p>At times, our existence can become as stifling as the interior of the spiciest pepper. We might feel as if we’re surrounded by walls of intense heat from every direction. The exhaustion we experience, both physically and mentally, can be profoundly disheartening. It might be tempting to succumb to the pain quietly.</p>

  <p>Let’s draw inspiration from the resilience of the worm. Despite the chaos and difficulties that surround us, let’s stand firm. Let’s resist the urge to give up. We must reenter the struggle repeatedly until we reach our aspirations. “No” should not be an option until we achieve our dreams. As long as we are breathing, hope persists.</p>
